## Prompts used to build this project

1. I'm building a React app with Vite that will allow users to upload and preview PDF files. Write a component that: 
  - lets the user upload a file from disk
  - validates that the file is a PDF
  - displays the uploaded PDF using react-pdf
  - make sure it works with local uploaded files (not URLs) 
  - shows a simple fallback message if the file is invalid or unreadable
  Write all the CSS styles in separate file and write dependencies to be installed.

2. file upload works but then it displayes a file in form of a photo and below text from this pdf with a default formating

3. Instead of displaying pages of the uploaded file one below another, modify the component in order to navigate the document via the navbar with "current page of all pages" and arrows to go to the next or previous page

4. Add drag & drop functionality

5. Add file upload progress

6. Enhance the UI by making it responsive and more modern. It should be clean and simple. You can add some colors. Add a heading or pargraph (or both) on the top of the website that'll briefly describe what the website is for

7. Write a short readme including:
- technologies used
- info that there is no backend
- features: responsive design, drag & drop, highlight that the loading bar is simulated, just for UI improvement

8. When navigating the document, viewport is moving to the top of the website which each change of the page, what requires user to scroll to the document view each time. When going back to the pages that were already viewed, the problem doesn't occur. Make the displayed file a default viewport position (proposed solution not used)

9. Reserve space for the PDF content so that navigation doesnâ€™t trigger layout shifts (which cause scroll jumps).
    
10. add zoom in/ zoom out functionality on the document
    
11. Disable zoom buttons after they reach max zoom in or out or set a limits on a scale variable to prevent users from clicking too many times one button after the max zoom was already reached and then having to click the same number of times second button to undo changes
